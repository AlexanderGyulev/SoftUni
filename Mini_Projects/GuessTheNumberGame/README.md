# Project Title:
Guess The Number Game

# Description: 
It's a simple game, created in Python - the program generates a random number between 1 and 50, and the user has to guess it. If the number guessed by the user is incorrect, 
the program will provide a hint.

## There are 4 possible scenarios:
The number guessed by the user is lower than the random generated number - in which case, the program will display a text, saying that the guessed number is lower than the random number

The number guessed by the user is higher than the random generated number - in which case, the program will display a text, saying that the guessed number is higher than the random number

The number guessed by the user is equal to the random generated number - in which case, the program will display a text and will ask the player if they want to play again

There are no more tries left - in which case, the program will display a text, will reveal the random generated number and will ask the player if they want to play again
