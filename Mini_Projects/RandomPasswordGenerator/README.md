# Project Title

Random Password Generator

# Description

This program generates a random password. The user has the option to choose how many characters they want their password to have (as long as the number is different than 0 and less than 50).
The program generates a random number and then turns that number to a character using the chr() Python function.

The user also has a choice to generate a new password after the first one is generated.
